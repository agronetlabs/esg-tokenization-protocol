# 🌐 ESG - Tokenization Protocol

> **Reference Implementation for EIP-8040: ESG - Tokenization Protocol**

> ⚠️ **Notice**: The Ethereum EIPs repository has recently [split ERCs and EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7206). ERCs are now maintained at [github.com/ethereum/ercs](https://github.com/ethereum/ercs). EIP-8040 is an **ERC** (Ethereum Request for Comment), and discussions should reference the official ERC repository.
**discussions-to: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-8040-esg-tokenization-protocol/25846**

## 🚀 Institutional-Grade Blockchain, Compliance & Security

**AgroCrypto Quantum Core** is the official reference implementation of the **AgroCrypto Quantum Governance Protocol (EIP-8040 Draft)** — a compliance-native, AI-governed, and post-quantum secure ESG tokenization standard for agriculture, forestry, carbon markets, and environmental asset management.

Built entirely in **pure Rust**, this project delivers:

- ✅ Deterministic issuance flows  
- ✅ Machine-verifiable metadata  
- ✅ ATF-AI audit integration  
- ✅ Quantum-ready key infrastructure  
- ✅ Institutional-grade security and lifecycle integrity

This is not a legacy enterprise stack — it's a modern, auditable, and standards-aligned infrastructure for real-world ESG deployment.

## 🏆 Why This Project Stands Out

- ✅ 100% pure, maintainable, and auditable Rust codebase  
- ✅ Badges for compliance, audit, CI/CD, provenance  
- ✅ Detailed documentation (README, CHANGELOG, SECURITY_AUDIT)  
- ✅ Ready for independent audit and institutional adoption  
- ✅ Aligned with open standards (EIP-8040, ESG, post-quantum security)  
- ✅ Real-world showcase of advanced Rust, Web3, and security engineering
